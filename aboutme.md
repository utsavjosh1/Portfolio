# 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm **Utsav Joshi**, a passionate Software Engineer with over 1 year of professional experience and 3+ years of involvement in the tech field.

Over the years, I've collaborated with clients, built personal projects, and focused on solving real-world problems through clean code, automation, and product thinking. I'm especially interested in creating tools that bridge AI with everyday workflows.

Currently, I'm building:

- **JobHaunt** – An AI-powered job scraping bot that integrates automation and smart filtering.
- **QuizGPT** – A quiz-generating microservice designed for my upcoming B2B SaaS application.
- **Learnest** – A CMS platform tailored for coaching institutes and educators.
- **LeadGen Scraper** – A data-focused tool to automate lead generation from various online sources.
